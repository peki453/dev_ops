## Lab 1: Python App

For my simple app I have used Python and FastAPI.

You can find more about Python best practices in `PYTHON.md` file.

## Lab 2: Docker

In this lab we get started with Docker.

You can find more about Docker best practices in `DOCKER.md` file.

## Lab 3: Continuous Integration (CI)

Third lab was about Unit Testing and Continuous Integration (CI).

Since my application is very simple, I tested just if response from request to main page is 200 (`STATUS 200 OK`).

You can find more about CI and Jenkins best practices in `CI.md` file. 
Moreover, in `PYTHON.md` file you can find list of best practices for Python Unit Testing.

You can find more about Terraform best practices in `TF.md` file.
