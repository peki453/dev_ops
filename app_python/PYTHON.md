# Python: Best Practices

## Best practices for Python programming

- Write readable and organized code.
- Document your code (for small projects comments are enough).
- Use know text editor (e.g. PyCharm).
- Object-oriented programming paradigm.
- Use virtual environments.

## My unit tests

Since my application is very simple, I tested just if response from request to main page is 200 (`STATUS 200 OK`).

## Best practices for Python testing

- Tests should run as fast as possible.
- Use descriptive names for testing functions.
- Each unit test should be able to run independently from other unit tests.
- Each unit test should test small parts of functionality.
- Test your application before pushing it to repository. 
- Use tests for debugging.
